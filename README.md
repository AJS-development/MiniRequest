# SimpleRequest
Why use an entire npm library such as Request to just do a small task? so use SimpleRequest! It is all in one file (index.js) and if you dont want to use npm, use minified.js in your own projects! Dont want to have it in a separate file? Remove the line ``module.exports = request`` and put it in your code and you can use it by just calling the function request!
